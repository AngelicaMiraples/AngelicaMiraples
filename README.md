# Hello and welcome! 🌊

My name is Angelica. I'm a graduate student at the University of Guelph. 

# My research background 🎒
I am a University of Toronto St. George Campus Alum. I completed my BSc in Molecular and Cell Biology & Human Biology and then my MSc in the Dept. of Cell and Systems Biology. My research focused on Cyclic Nuceotide Gated-Ion Channels in Arabidopsis, exploring functional redundancy using a reverse genetics approach. Other skills: protein purification and interaction techniques, pathogen infection assays, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.

My current research focuses on the maize microbiome, maize development and anatomy and bioinformatics. My other expertises include knowledge of sequencing technologies, commandline, HPC, R visualizations.

# I'm still learning many things 🌱
Science is always changing! One of my hopes is to continue to learn new skills that are applicable in this changing world. I'm always looking to make connections and collaborate on new, exciting projects. 

# Promotion of open science practices 👯🌍
Making data accessible is one of the best practices researchers can adopt. This aids in the replicability of work, and advancement of research at the individual and global scale. SO! If you have any questions about my research or are looking for any scripts or data that I have used or continue to use... perhaps you notice an issue in my code or are having trouble utilizing it for a different purpose? Let me know! Let's help eachother establish a proactive space for researchers, where asking questions and facing difficults is all part of the journey! ✨
